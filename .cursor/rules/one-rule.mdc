# Video Editor Development Rules for Cursor AI

## üéØ START HERE - Read This First

**Before doing ANYTHING:**

1. **Read `memory-bank/activeContext.md`** - Current work focus, active decisions
2. **Read `memory-bank/progress.md`** - What's done, what's next
3. **Reference `_docs/architecture.md`** - When implementing features or making decisions

These files contain all project context. Don't duplicate their content here.

---

## Core Principles

**Project:** Desktop video editor (CapCut Clone)  
**Stack:** Tauri (Rust + React) + TypeScript + Konva.js + FFmpeg + Zustand  
**Platform:** macOS (MVP)

**Goal:** Build robust MVP that prioritizes video processing reliability and clean architecture.

## Workflow Rules

### Rule 1: Ask Before Acting

**STOP and ask when:**
- Requirements unclear or multiple solutions exist
- Decision impacts architecture
- Adding functionality not in task-list-mvp.md
- Uncertain about completion criteria
- Errors with multiple possible causes
- FFmpeg or Tauri IPC concerns

**Format:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CLARIFICATION NEEDED
Context: [what you're working on]
Issue: [uncertainty]
Options: [2-3 approaches]
Recommendation: [suggested approach with reasoning]
```

### Rule 2: Check-In After Every Task

**After completing ANY task:**

1. STOP - don't proceed automatically
2. Report using this format:
```
‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED
Task: [Task X.Y from task-list-mvp.md]
Changes: [files modified/created]
Testing: [what you tested, results]
Acceptance Criteria: [checklist from task]
Ready for Next: [Yes/No]
Blockers: [any issues]
```
3. WAIT for approval before next task

### Rule 3: Never Auto-Commit

- ‚ùå NEVER commit automatically
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS ask first using:
```
üìù READY TO COMMIT
Files changed: [list]
Proposed message: [Phase X.Y] [description]
Options: A) Commit now B) Wait C) Modify message
```

**Commit format:** `[Phase X.Y] Brief description`

### Rule 4: Document When Needed

After completing a task, **ASK** if you should create a context summary:

```
üìÑ CREATE CONTEXT SUMMARY?

Task completed: [Task X.Y name]
Complexity: [Straightforward / Complex / Critical]
Next file number: [N based on existing files]
Suggested filename: N_YYYY.MM.DD.description.md

Recommend creating summary: [Yes/No - with brief reason]

Would you like me to create a context summary?
A) Yes, create it
B) No, skip for now
```

**When to recommend creating summaries:**
- ‚úÖ Difficult bug fixes with non-obvious solutions
- ‚úÖ Important architectural decisions or discoveries
- ‚úÖ Complex FFmpeg command constructions
- ‚úÖ Tricky Tauri IPC integrations
- ‚úÖ Performance optimizations with specific techniques
- ‚úÖ Security considerations or permission configurations
- ‚ùå Straightforward implementations following existing patterns
- ‚ùå Simple component creation with no special considerations

**File naming format:** `N_YYYY.MM.DD.description.md`
- `N` = Sequential number starting at 0, increment for each new summary
- `YYYY.MM.DD` = Date (e.g., 2025.01.15)
- `description` = Brief kebab-case description (e.g., `setup-project-structure`)

**Examples:**
- `0_2025.01.15.setup-project-structure.md`
- `1_2025.01.15.ffmpeg-binary-path-resolution.md`
- `2_2025.01.16.fix-timeline-drag-performance.md`

**Summary Content Guidelines:**

**Keep summaries SUCCINCT** - focus on key information:

```markdown
# Context Summary: [Task X.Y - Task Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Complexity:** [Straightforward/Complex/Critical]

## Overview
[1-2 sentences: what was implemented]

## Key Files
- `path/to/file` - [one line purpose]

## Important Details
[ONLY include if relevant - omit entire section if not needed]

### Bug Fix / Discovery / Decision
[Detailed explanation of the non-obvious solution, discovery, or decision]
[Why this approach was chosen over alternatives]
[What to watch out for in the future]

### Code Pattern
[Only include critical code snippets that future sessions MUST know]
[NOT for simple implementations - only novel or tricky patterns]

## Testing Notes
[Brief testing approach - expand if complex edge cases discovered]

## Next Steps
[What depends on this or should be done next]
```

**What to include in "Important Details" section:**
- Non-obvious bug fixes (root cause + solution reasoning)
- Architectural decisions that deviate from or extend architecture.md
- FFmpeg command gotchas or performance tricks
- Tauri permission issues and resolutions
- Complex state management patterns
- Performance optimizations with measurable impact
- Security considerations

**What to OMIT:**
- Routine implementations that follow established patterns
- Obvious file changes (list files, but don't explain obvious changes)
- Standard React component creation
- Straightforward type definitions
- Simple bug fixes with clear error messages

**To find next number:** Check existing files in `_context-summaries/` and use highest N + 1

---

## Architecture Compliance

**Follow `_docs/architecture.md` specifications:**
- 11 independent modules with explicit dependencies
- Exact type definitions from Module 2
- Zustand store patterns from Module 3
- Tauri IPC from Module 4
- FFmpeg integration from Module 5

**Before implementing any module:** Read complete specification in architecture.md

---

## Technical Standards

### TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Strict mode, no `any`
- ‚úÖ Type all parameters and returns
- ‚úÖ Functional components with hooks only
- ‚úÖ Components <200-300 lines
- ‚ùå NO class components
- ‚ùå NO prop drilling beyond 2 levels

### Rust
- ‚úÖ All commands return `Result<T, String>`
- ‚úÖ Parse FFmpeg output as JSON
- ‚úÖ Include stderr in error messages
- ‚úÖ Test FFmpeg commands manually first

### Performance Targets
- Timeline responsive with 10+ clips
- Preview at 30fps minimum
- App launch <5 seconds
- No memory leaks

See `_docs/react-best-practices.md` for complete standards.

## Testing Requirements

Before marking task complete:
- [ ] Compiles without errors (TS + Rust)
- [ ] No linting warnings
- [ ] Works in dev (`npm run tauri dev`)
- [ ] Tested with sample videos
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Performance targets met

---

## Error Handling

When errors occur:
1. Read full error message
2. Check docs (Tauri, FFmpeg, React)
3. Report with:
```
üö® ERROR ENCOUNTERED
Type: [Rust/TypeScript/FFmpeg]
Message: [full error]
Location: [file:line]
Analysis: [root cause]
Solution: [proposed fix]
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
```
4. WAIT for approval

---

## MVP Scope

**IN SCOPE:** Import, timeline, preview, trim, export to MP4  
**OUT OF SCOPE:** Recording, multiple tracks, undo/redo, project save, effects

See `memory-bank/productContext.md` for complete scope.

---

## Communication

**Status Indicators:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clarification needed
- ‚úÖ Task completed
- üìù Ready to commit
- üö® Error encountered
- üìÑ Context summary prompt
- üí° Suggestion
- ü§î Need help
- ‚ö° Performance concern
- üîí Security concern
- üé¨ FFmpeg note
- ‚öôÔ∏è Rust/Tauri note

**Be concise, proactive, and honest.**

---

## Session Management

**Every session start:**
- [ ] Read activeContext.md
- [ ] Review progress.md
- [ ] Check current task in task-list-mvp.md
- [ ] Ask about blockers

**Every 5 tasks or 2 hours:**
- Ask if you should create session summary: `N_YYYY.MM.DD.session-summary.md` in `_context-summaries/`
- Session summaries should be more comprehensive than task summaries

**Session end:**
- [ ] Document progress
- [ ] Note blockers
- [ ] Suggest next steps

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. ‚úÖ Follow architecture.md module specs
2. ‚úÖ Ask when uncertain
3. ‚úÖ Check in after tasks
4. ‚úÖ Never auto-commit
5. ‚úÖ Ask before creating summaries (recommend for complex/critical tasks only)
6. ‚úÖ Keep summaries succinct - details only when needed
7. ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode
8. ‚úÖ Sequential task development
9. ‚úÖ Test with real videos

---

## Quick Reference

**Before any work:** activeContext.md ‚Üí progress.md ‚Üí architecture.md  
**When uncertain:** Stop and ask  
**After task:** Check in ‚Üí ask about summary (if complex/critical) ‚Üí ask about commit ‚Üí wait  
**Before commit:** Ask for approval  
**Every module:** Read architecture.md spec first  

**Success measured by:**
- ‚úÖ MVP tasks completed (task-list-mvp.md)
- ‚úÖ Video processing works flawlessly
- ‚úÖ Clean, type-safe code
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation (when needed)
- ‚úÖ Architecture compliance

---

**Remember:** Ask questions > make assumptions. Working MVP > feature creep. Read memory-bank files first. Document discoveries, not routine work.
