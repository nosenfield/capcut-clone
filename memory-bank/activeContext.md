# Active Context - CapCut Clone Video Editor

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Current Phase**: Phase 6 Complete (Basic Editing)  
**Session Type**: Development

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Phase 6 (Basic Editing) fully implemented with clip selection and trim controls.

Phases 1-6 complete. Timeline editing now includes clip selection (with visual feedback), keyboard delete support, and trim handles for adjusting clip start/end points. All timeline interactions are working smoothly with proper constraints.

## Recent Changes

### Latest Session (2025-01-27)
- **Task 6.2 Complete**: Implemented basic trim controls for clips
  - Added orange trim handles (8px wide) on left/right edges of selected clips
  - Left handle adjusts trimStart and updates clip position
  - Right handle adjusts trimEnd and clip duration
  - Implemented trim constraints (minimum 0.1s duration, can't exceed media duration)
  - Trim handles and clip name move with clip during drag
  - Fixed vertical position constraint for trim handles
- **Task 6.1 Complete**: Implemented clip selection on timeline
  - Added selectedClipId to timeline store with selectClip action
  - Clicking clip selects it with visual distinction (brighter blue, thicker border, enhanced shadow)
  - Clicking empty timeline space deselects
  - Delete/Backspace key removes selected clip
  - Only one clip selected at a time
- **Additional Improvements**: 
  - Prevented vertical dragging of clips (horizontal only)
  - Added delete button (×) to media library cards
  - Automatic cleanup of timeline clips when media is deleted
- **Task 4.1 Complete**: Created Timeline canvas component with Konva.js
  - Time ruler with second/minute markers
  - Draggable clip rectangles with labels
  - Red playhead with triangle indicator
  - Zoom controls (10-200 px/s)
  - Track backgrounds with left label panel
- **Created LayerPanel Component**: Shows all clips on timeline
- **Created PreviewPlayer Placeholder**: Displays thumbnail at playhead position
- **Fixed Critical Tailwind CSS v4 Issue**: 
  - Discovered empty `src/tailwindcss` file blocking imports
  - Installed missing `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
  - Added tailwindcss() to vite.config.ts
  - Tailwind now working correctly
- **Updated App Layout**: Matches reference design with 4 panels
  - Media Library (top-left) and Preview (top-right)
  - Layer Panel (bottom-left) and Timeline (bottom-right)
  - Fixed flex layout overflow issues

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Decisions Made
1. **Memory Bank Structure**: Following hierarchical documentation pattern with 6 core files
2. **Development Approach**: AI-first, modular development as outlined in architecture
3. **Platform Priority**: macOS-first, desktop-only for MVP
4. **Tauri v2 Permissions**: Using capabilities-based security model in `capabilities/default.json`
5. **Window Size**: 1280x800 default, 1024x600 minimum for video editing UI
6. **Bundle Target**: macOS only (dmg) for MVP
7. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Requires @tailwindcss/vite plugin (not PostCSS plugin)
8. **Layout Structure**: 4-panel design with flex-based responsive sizing
9. **Timeline Width**: 320px fixed for Media Library and Layer Panel

### Open Questions
- None currently - memory bank setup is straightforward

### Current Blockers
- None - project is ready to begin active development

### AI Assistant Instructions
When continuing work on this project:
1. **Read all memory bank files** to understand current state
2. **Reference architecture docs** for implementation details
3. **Follow MVP task list** for implementation order
4. **Update progress.md** after completing significant work
5. **Update activeContext.md** with current focus at start of each session

## Recent Discoveries

- Project has comprehensive architecture already documented
- Clear separation between MVP and full product features
- Modular design enables incremental development
- Tauri provides clean IPC boundary between React frontend and Rust backend
- **TailwindCSS v4**: Requires `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, not PostCSS plugin
- **TailwindCSS v4 Import**: Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS files
- **Empty File Bug**: Empty `src/tailwindcss` file blocked Tailwind imports (deleted)
- **Tauri v2 Permissions**: Uses capabilities-based model in `capabilities/default.json` (not permission arrays)
- **Plugin System**: Must install and initialize plugins in both `Cargo.toml` and `lib.rs`
- **Flex Layout**: Use `min-h-0` and `min-w-0` to allow flex items to shrink
- **Build Status**: Project builds and runs successfully
- **Konva Group Dragging**: Make the Group draggable, not individual elements - children position relative to Group (0,0)
- **Konva dragBoundFunc**: Returns absolute stage coordinates, not relative to parent Group
- **Konva Text Positioning**: Use `listening={false}` to prevent text from interfering with click events
