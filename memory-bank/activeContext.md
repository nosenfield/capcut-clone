# Active Context - CapCut Clone Video Editor

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX  
**Current Phase**: Initial Setup - Memory Bank Initialization  
**Session Type**: Setup

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective**: Initialize memory bank system for the CapCut Clone video editing project.

This session is focused on establishing comprehensive documentation that will persist across AI development sessions, ensuring continuity and clear context for future development work.

## Recent Changes

### This Session
- **Created memory bank structure** with all core documentation files:
  - `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document defining scope and goals
  - `productContext.md` - Purpose, problems, and user experience vision
  - `activeContext.md` - Current work focus (this file)
  - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and technical patterns
  - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and setup
  - `progress.md` - Implementation status and what works/doesn't

### Previous Work
- Project scaffold created using Tauri + React + TypeScript template
- Architecture documentation authored (`_docs/architecture.md`)
- MVP task list created (`_docs/task-list-mvp.md`)
- Full product task list created (`_docs/task-list-final.md`)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ **Memory bank initialization** (current task)
2. ⏳ **Review architecture documentation** to confirm understanding
3. ⏳ **Begin Task 1.1**: Initialize project structure and dependencies
   - Set up directory structure per architecture
   - Install Zustand, Konva, React-Konva, UUID
   - Configure TailwindCSS
   - Create comprehensive `.gitignore`

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Decisions Made
1. **Memory Bank Structure**: Following hierarchical documentation pattern with 6 core files
2. **Development Approach**: AI-first, modular development as outlined in architecture
3. **Platform Priority**: macOS-first, desktop-only for MVP

### Open Questions
- None currently - memory bank setup is straightforward

### Current Blockers
- None - project is ready to begin active development

## Context for AI Assistant

### Project State
- **Status**: Very early stage (template only)
- **Completed**: Documentation and project initialization
- **In Progress**: Memory bank documentation
- **Next**: Foundation tasks (Phase 1)

### Current Code State
The project currently contains only the default Tauri template:
- React app with greet function example
- Basic Rust backend with no custom commands
- No video editing functionality yet
- Dependencies: konva, react-konva, zustand, uuid installed but not used

### Key Files to Reference
- `_docs/architecture.md` - Complete system specification
- `_docs/task-list-mvp.md` - Detailed implementation tasks
- `package.json` - Dependencies list
- `src/App.tsx` - Default template code (will be replaced)

### AI Assistant Instructions
When continuing work on this project:
1. **Read all memory bank files** to understand current state
2. **Reference architecture docs** for implementation details
3. **Follow MVP task list** for implementation order
4. **Update progress.md** after completing significant work
5. **Update activeContext.md** with current focus at start of each session

## Recent Discoveries

- Project has comprehensive architecture already documented
- Clear separation between MVP and full product features
- Modular design enables incremental development
- Tauri provides clean IPC boundary between React frontend and Rust backend
- **TailwindCSS v4**: Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS files instead of requiring `tailwind.config.js` - no separate config file needed

## Communication Ponits

### Current Session Goals
- Establish memory bank as single source of truth
- Document project foundation clearly
- Prepare for active development phase
