# Product Context - CapCut Clone Video Editor

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement

Content creators and casual video editors need a simple, fast, and reliable tool for editing videos on macOS. Current solutions face trade-offs:
- **Professional tools** (Final Cut Pro, Premiere) are expensive and complex
- **Free tools** (iMovie) have limited features and export options
- **Online editors** raise privacy concerns and require internet
- **CapCut** (mobile-first) doesn't have a desktop native app

This project aims to create a **desktop-native video editor** that balances ease of use with professional features, all while maintaining user privacy through local processing.

### Target Use Cases

1. **Social Media Content**
   - Quick video trimming and assembly
   - Export to platform-specific formats
   - Minimal learning curve

2. **Tutorial Creation**
   - Screen recording + narration editing
   - Timeline-based precision editing
   - Clear export to common formats

3. **Personal Projects**
   - Home movie editing
   - Event video compilation
   - Family video sharing

## Core Value Proposition

### Primary Value
- **Fast, Simple, Native** video editing for macOS
- **Privacy-First** - all processing happens locally
- **Free and Open** - no subscription, full control

### Key Differentiators
1. **Desktop-First Design** - built for mouse and keyboard
2. **Lightweight Bundle** - small download with bundled FFmpeg
3. **No Cloud Required** - fully offline capable
4. **Open Architecture** - extensible, modifiable
